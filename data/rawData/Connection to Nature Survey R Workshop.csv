PARTICIPANT INFORMATION

 

Project Title: City of Melbourne residents' and visitors' connection to nature

 

You are invited to participate in a survey on how you feel about and access nature in the City of Melbourne. The purpose of this survey is to identify ways the City of Melbourne can enhance city users' experience of nature in the city. The survey will ask you questions about your own experiences in nature within the City of Melbourne, your perceptions, and the sustainability behaviours you engage in. You will also be prompted to answer questions about Melbourne more generally and demographics.

 

This study is funded by the City of Melbourne and developed in collaboration with researchers at RMIT University. The City of Melbourne abides by the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014. The RMIT Human Research Ethics Committee has approved this project, see details below.





If I agree to participate, what will I be required to do?

The survey should take between 15 to 20 minutes. We do not ask for any identifying information. We will ask for basic, non-identifying demographic information (e.g. age and gender) and to answer questions related to your experience in nature.





What will happen to the information I provide?

Responses will be collated and stored in a spreadsheet as group data, then subjected to analyses. Results may be published in academic journals and presented at academic conferences. Only summary information will be disseminated. Again, no identifying information will be collected as part of the survey. Once we have completed our data collection and analysis, we will make the data freely available on the Open Science Framework as part of an effort to increase transparency in science.



 

Who should I contact if I have any questions?

If you have any questions about your participation, please contact Matthew Selinske at matthew.selinske@rmit.edu.au.

 

If you have any concerns about your participation in this project, which you do not wish to discuss with the researchers, then you can contact the Research Ethics Co-ordinator, Research Integrity, Governance and Systems, RMIT University, GPO Box 2476V  VIC  3001.

","Melbourne has NO SOUL, the infrastructure around which it is built and a total lack of decent roadways and ability to transit around or thhrough it is woeful. Take DOCKLANDS as an example, buildings stacked so close together such as sunlight in places barely seems to touch the ground except at high noon, transport in and out is diablical and as a place to go for nature or natural interaction nonexisistent. East Melbourne, Fawkner Park (I think) is a great ""looking"" place but wasted because public transport is limited, after dark is less than friendly and in Winter or such times as the very wet season appears to be a miserable place to be. Having seen some activities aroud there such as locals living in the high rises and the appearance of more of them going up I feel it will become limited because it appears to be very fragile. I see nothing that even looks like someone planning for integrated facilities such as toilet blocks, dogs / pet friendly areas for use and even place where wedding parties, public events, music / open air events could be staged seemed to have been denied the ""local"" population because it is desired to ""Keep the local ammentity"" by a few from the many. Note this is also common in many other parts of the Greater Melbourne and unfortunately it seems a lot of activity has been ""priced out"" of the cities and they are just a bland mix of parks with a few spots that get all the attention because they are part event such as Moomba on the river frontage or around the sports preceint.
